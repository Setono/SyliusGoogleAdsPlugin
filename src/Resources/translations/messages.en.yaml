            <p>Here you create conversion actions that match the conversion actions you have created inside your Google Ads interface.</p>
            <p>It's very <strong>important</strong> that the name of the conversion matches the name in the Google Ads interface exactly.
            The name is used for associating conversions in your Sylius shop with the conversion action in Google Ads.
            If the names doesn't match you won't have conversion data inside Google Ads.</p>
            <p>When you create a new conversion action you choose the category and this category determines whether the
            conversion is tracked automatically or your developer has to implement it manually. The only category that
            is tracked automatically is the <code>Purchase</code> category.</p>
            <p>Here is a video from Google describing and telling how to setup offline conversion tracking:
